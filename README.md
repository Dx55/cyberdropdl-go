# cyberdropdl-go
A simple zero-dependency downloader written in Go for cyberdrop.me

This is a project made purely for fun, as a test for my Go skills and as a joking challenge for me to not use any dependency.

Feel free to issue a problem or give an advice.

Usage (Linux):
```
./cyberdropdl <cyberdrop link>
```

Usage (Windows):
```
cyberdropdl <cyberdrop link>
```

Build:
```
git clone https://github.com/Dx55/cyberdropdl-go/
cd cyberdropdl-go
go build cyberdropdl.go
```

The script will create a directory and will download all the files given from the link.
